    Javascript is most popular programming language
    It is the programming language of the web


                                    Javascript Functions

    
    A Javascript Function is a block of code that can be executed when we called


                                         Javascript Variables


     A Variable is a container that holds data/values . variables are used to store and manipulate data in program

     Variable Declaration
             - we can declare variables using keywords

            . var : used for Variable declaration in older version of Javascript. But now it's not recommended to use
            . let : variables declared with 'let' keyword have block scope,(they are limited to the block in which they are defined)
            . const: used to create constant variables which Variables that cannot be reassigned


                                             Data Types

         Javascript has several datatypes:

                1) Primitive data types
                         . Number : represents numeric values
                         . String : represents string(textual) data
                         . Boolean : represents boolean value (true or false)
                         . Null    : represents null value 
                         . Undefined : represents undefined value
                         . Symbol   : represents symbolic value

                2) Non-primitive data type
                        . Object : collection of key-value pairs. Object can hold various data types & Functions
                        . Array : Represents a list of elements,typically same type
                        . Function : Represents a block of code that can be executed when we called


      concatenating strings (+)

       in Javascript the '+' symbol is used for concatenating strings as well as addition when used with numbers 
       (joins two or more strings together)


                                             Conditional Statements

        Conditional Statements allow you to make decisions in our code based on conditions. 
        if,else if,else

        syntax:

        if (condition){
                     //code to execute if the condition is true
          }
          else if (next condition){
                     //code to execute if the first condition was false and next condition is true
           }
           else{
                     //code to execute if all previous conditions were false
           }

                        
                                        Loops in js

        
        Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition met.
        For loop, While loop, Do..while loop
        for loop :
            - Syntax : for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
                                {
                                         // code to execute
                                }

        While loop:
        - Syntax : while(condition){
                //code to execute
        }

        Do..While loop
        - Syntax : do{
                   //code to execute
               }while(condition);



                                        Array in js

        
        an array is a data structure that stores a list of elements. hold various data types : numbers, strings, 
        objects and nested array(array inside an another array)

        let newarray = [1,2,3,4,5];
        array[0]=1
        array[1]=2........



                                        Objects in Javascript


        It is a datatype that allows us to store collection of key-value pairs

        syntax - let person{
                name:"John",
                age:30,
                city:"New York"
              };
        }



                                        JQuery

        JQuery is a Javascript library that makes it easier to interact with HTML elements
        handle events animations.

                JQuery library contains:
                > HTML/DOM manipulation
                > CSS manipulation
                > Effects & animations
                > Ajax
